# CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries

This repository contains the top-scoring notebooks from my participation in the Kaggle competition "CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries". The goal of the competition was to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. Our models evaluate how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.
